# SoulSyncAI
SoulSync AI is a web app where users can share their feelings, get calming responses, track their mood over time, and receive personalized emotional tips. It uses the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) + external ML/NLP API (OpenAI, Gemini, HuggingFace, or your custom ML model).
